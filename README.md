Mixed Reality immersive experience of known exoplanets with smart filtering for locating earth-like exoplanets. This app will provide context + presence of the planets + star systems, giving an alternate way for scientists to look at the data.

We gratefully acknowledge the assets we used came from <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/GalaxyExplorer">Galaxy Explorer</a> and some scripts and components from the pre-release of the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity">Mixed Reality Toolkit vNEXT</a>. <a href="https://github.com/kimsama/Unity-QuickSheet">QuickSheet</a> was used to read XLS spread sheets into Unity as collections of Scriptable Objects. 

This project has made use of the <a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/">NASA Exoplanet Archive</a>, which is operated by the California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under the Exoplanet Exploration Program. Additioanl data was obtained from the <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/">Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia</a>.
